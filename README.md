# Dungeons & Dragons & Diapers
An ultra light-weight TTRPG system. Less rules, more fun. 

## Stats
There are 3 stats: `Magic`, `Slic` and `Combic`.

| Stat   | What |
|--------|--------|
| `Magic`  | Anything related to magic and spells and stuff |
| `Slic`   | Anything related to sneaking, hiding, deception, perception, social, acting, acrobatics etc| 
| `Combic` | Anything related to physical combat |


## Create a character
A player character (PC) starts out with 20 experience points (`XP`). These are divide freely between the three stats. Depending on how these are split, you get different "class" or "archetypes". Mix however you like, or go with one of these examples:

| Stat   | Barbaris | Trickster | Hypnoticos | Pistolero | Wizard  | The guy |
|--------|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| `Magic`  | 0        | 9         | 13         | 3         | 15      | 6       |
| `Slic`    | 5        | 14        | 10         | 7         | 2       | 7       |
| `Combic` | 15       | 7         | 7          | 12        | 3       | 7       |

Want to play an elf? Sure you do! Here's how races work. Check the table below, add/subtract stats and gain the abilities listed. See below for more abilities.

| Race     | Stat +    | Stat -    | Abilities   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Centaur  | +2 combat | -2 sly    | Large, fast |
| Dwarf    | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Slow, tough |
| Elf      | +2 magic  | -2 combat | Nightvision |

| Goblin   | +2 sly    | -2 magic  | Small, goldnose, ugly |
| Grootish | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Hardy          |
| Halfling | +2 sly    | -2 combat | Small |
| Human    | +1 any    | -1 any    | -          |
| Orc      | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Tough      |
| Robot    | +2 combat | -2 sly    | Iron health    |


## Experience
Each game night, all PCs present gain one `XP` at the start of the session and another point of `XP` at the end of the session.

## Hit Points (HP)
`HP` = `XP` * 5. Your `HP` equals the number of `XP` a character has gained, times 5. E.g. 20 experience points = 100 HP.

## Defense
`Defense` reduces the amount of damage received. Say you have 5 defense and a troll hits you for 21 damage: 21 - 5 = 16 damage taken. A PC has 0 defense, but armor up to improve:

| Gear           | Bonus |
|----------------|:-----:|
| Leather armor  | 1     |
| Chain mail     | 4     | 
| Plate mail     | 8     | 
| Small* shield  | 1     |
| Medium* shield | 2     |
| Large* shield  | 4     |
* relative to body size

## Movement
A character can move 5. Five what? Exactly. If you want to use a battlemap for tactical combat, `move` represents the number of squares a PC can move per round. If you need to translate that number to meters, a move of 5 equals 15 meters of movement.

## Doing stuff
When it's your turn you can do one thing, e.g. move, attack, cast a spell, hide behind a bush, etc. Declare what the PC wants to do. The GM decalares what the `Difficulty` is (see table below for guidance). You roll a d20 and add the appropriate stat value (`Magic`, `Slic` or `Combic`). If the total is equal or higher to the `difficulty`, it was a success. If you roll 20, it was a critical success.

| Description       | Difficulty |
|-------------------|:----------:|
| Walk in the park  | 5          |
| Trivial           | 8          | 
| Easy              | 10         | 
| Doable            | 12         |
| A bit tricky      | 15         |
| Rather tricky     | 20         |
| Difficult         | 15         | 
| Very difficult    | 35         | 
| Nearly impossible | 40         | 
| Impossible        | 50         | 

## Combat
Declare who/what you want to attack. The GM decalares what the `Difficulty` is (see the Doing stuff table). You roll a d20 and add the `Combic` value and your weapon bonus. If the total is below the difficulty, you miss. If it's greater or equal, the total number is also the damage you deal to your enemy.

| Weapon         | Bonus | Special |
|----------------|:-----:| ------- |
| Dagger/knife   | 1     | 1h      |
| Club/bat       | 1     | 1h      |
| Shortsword     | 3     | 1h      |
| Longsword      | 6     | 1h      |
| Shield bash    | 2     | 1h      |
| Hand axe       | 4     | 1h      |
| Hammertime     | 5     | 1h      |
| Battle axe     | 6     | 1h      |
| Greataxe       | 8     | 2h      |
| Greatsword     | 8     | 2h      |
| Maul           | 7     | 2h      |
| Spear          | 5     | 2h      |
| Flintlock pistol | 3     | 1h, r50|
| Shortbow       | 2     | 2h, r100|
| Longbow        | 4     | 2h, r300|
| Crossbow       | 5     | 2h, r150|

## Abilities

There are abilities, you can get these from your `race` (see above), or buy them for `XP` (WIP, more to come on this). Abilities stack, apply instances cumulatively, e.g. `Hardy 3` bestows +15 `defense`.

| Ability      | Effect |
|--------------|-------------|
| Large        | +1 `move`, +4 when attacked |
| Small        | -1 `move`, -4 when attacked |
| Tough        | `HP` = `XP` * 6 (not *5) |
| Goldnose     | Can sniff out gold withing 30 meters |
| Hardy        | +5 `defense`  |
| Nightvision  | Can see in the dark |
| Fast         | +2 `move`  |
| Slow         | -2 `move`  |
| Crit attack  | Attacks bypass target defense |
| Extra attack | +1 number of attacks each round  |
| Hidey        | +10 hide  |

| Iron health  | Ignore most diseases  |
| Alert        | +10 perception |

## Magic/spells
Works the same way as `Doing stuff`: Declare what you want to do --> GM declares difficulty -> d20 + stat --> resolve what happens depending on success or failure.

## Magic items
