# Dungeons & Dragons & Diapers
An ultra light-weight TTRPG system. Less rules, more fun. Examples below give a medieval fantasy flavor, but you'll find that making DDD work for any type of setting is easy. 

## Stats
There are 3 stats: `Magic`, `Slic` and `Combic`.

| Stat   | What |
|--------|--------|
| `Magic`  | Anything related to magic and spells and stuff |
| `Slic`   | Anything related to sneaking, hiding, deception, perception, social, acting, acrobatics etc| 
| `Combic` | Anything related to physical combat |


## Create a character
A player character (PC) starts out with 20 experience points (`XP`). These points are divided freely between the three stats. Depending on how these are split, you get a different "class" or "archetype". Mix however you like, or go with one of these examples:

| Stat    | Barbaris | Trickster | Hypnoticos | Pistolero | Wizard  | Joe |
|---------|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| `Magic` | 0        | 2         | 10         | 3         | 15      | 6       |
| `Slic`  | 5        | 14        | 7          | 6         | 2       | 7       |
| `Combic`| 15       | 4         | 3          | 11        | 3       | 7       |


## Race
Want to play an elf? Sure you do! Here's how races work. Check the table below, add/subtract stats and gain the abilities listed. See below for more abilities.

| Race     | Stat +    | Stat -    | Abilities   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Centaur  | +2 combat | -2 sly    | Large, fast |
| Dwarf    | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Slow, tough |
| Elf      | +2 magic  | -2 combat | Nightvision | 
| Gnome    | +2 magic  | -2 combat | Small       |
| Goblin   | +2 sly    | -2 magic  | Small, goldnose, ugly |
| Grootish | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Hardy          |
| Halfling | +2 sly    | -2 combat | Small |
| Human    | +1 any    | -1 any    | Lucky         |
| Orc      | +2 combat | -2 magic  | Tough      |
| Robot    | +2 combat | -2 sly    | Iron health    |


## Experience
Each game session, all PCs present gain one point of `XP` at session start, and another point of `XP` at the end of the session.

## Hit Points (HP)
`HP` = `XP` * 5. Your `HP` equals the number of `XP` a character has gained, multiplied by 5. E.g. 20 `XP` would result in a character with 100 `HP`.

## Defense
`Defense` reduces the amount of damage received. E.g. you have 5 defense and a troll hits you for 23 damage: 23 - 5 = 18 damage taken. A PC has 0 defense, but can armor up to improve:

| Gear           | Bonus |
|----------------|:-----:|
| Leather armor  | 1     |
| Chain mail     | 4     | 
| Plate mail     | 8     | 
| Small* shield  | 1     |
| Medium* shield | 2     |
| Large* shield  | 4     |

* relative to body size

## Movement
A character can move 5. Five what? Exactly. If you want to use a battlemap for tactical combat, `move` represents the number of squares a PC can move per round. If you really need to translate that number to meters, multiply `move` value by 3 to get meters.

## Doing stuff
When it's your turn you can do one thing, e.g. move, attack, cast a spell, hide behind a bush, etc. Declare what the PC wants to do. The GM decalares what the `Difficulty` is (see table below for guidance). You roll a d20 and add the appropriate stat value (`Magic`, `Slic` or `Combic`). If the total is equal or higher to the `difficulty`, it's a success. If you roll 20, it's an extraordinary success.

| Description       | Difficulty |
|-------------------|:----------:|
| Walk in the park  | 5          |
| Trivial           | 8          | 
| Easy              | 10         | 
| Doable            | 12         |
| A bit tricky      | 15         |
| Rather tricky     | 20         |
| Difficult         | 15         | 
| Very difficult    | 35         | 
| Nearly impossible | 40         | 
| Impossible        | 50         | 

## Combat
Declare who/what you want to attack. The GM decalares what the `Difficulty` is (see the Doing stuff table). As a default, hitting somebody is "A bit tricky". You roll a d20 and add your `Combic` value and your weapon bonus. If the total is below the `difficulty`, you miss. If it's greater or equal, the total number is also the damage you deal to your enemy.

| Weapon         | Bonus | Special |
|----------------|:-----:| ------- |
| Dagger/knife   | 1     | 1h      |
| Club/bat       | 1     | 1h      |
| Shortsword     | 3     | 1h      |
| Longsword      | 6     | 1h      |
| Shield bash    | 2     | 1h      |
| Hand axe       | 4     | 1h      |
| Hammertime     | 5     | 1h      |
| Battle axe     | 6     | 1h      |
| Greataxe       | 8     | 2h      |
| Greatsword     | 8     | 2h      |
| Maul           | 7     | 2h      |
| Spear          | 5     | 2h      |
| Flintlock pistol | 3   | 1h, range 50|
| Shortbow       | 2     | 2h, range 100|
| Longbow        | 4     | 2h, range 300|
| Crossbow       | 5     | 2h, range 150|

## Abilities

You get abilities from your `race` (see above), or buy them for `XP` (WIP, more to come on this). Abilities stack, apply instances cumulatively, e.g. `Hardy 3` bestows +15 `defense`.

| Ability      | Effect |
|--------------|-------------|
| Alert        | +10 perception |
| Bouncy       | +10 jump  |
| Crit attack  | Attacks bypass target defense |
| Extra attack | +1 number of attacks each round  |
| Fast         | +2 `move`  |
| Goldnose     | Can sniff out gold within 30 meters |
| Hardy        | +5 `defense`  |
| Healer       | Can heal a number of `HP` equal to your own `XP` |
| Hidey        | +10 hide  |
| Iron belly   | Ignore most poison |
| Iron health  | Ignore most diseases  |
| Iron fist    | +4 when attacking without a weapon  |
| Just ate     | You are nourished as if you just ate a nice meal |
| Large        | +1 `move`, +4 when attacked |
| Lucky        | 1/day reroll a d20 if you're unhappy with the result. You must take the second roll.|
| Nightvision  | Can see in the dark |
| Slow         | -2 `move`  |
| Small        | -1 `move`, -4 when attacked |
| Tough        | `HP` = `XP` * 6 (instead of * 5) |
| Ugly         | -10 on social interactions|

## Magic/spells
Works the same way as `Doing stuff`. Declare what you want to do --> GM declares difficulty -> Roll d20 and add `Magic` stat --> resolve what happens depending on success or failure.

## Magic items
There are naturally magic items! Here are some examples:

| Item         | Effect |
|--------------|-------------|
| Magic sword  | +3 `combic` when wielded, 1/encounter gain the `Crit attack` abilty |
| Enchanted pistol    | +3 `combic`, on hit pushes target backwards |
| Magic shield  | +3 `defense` when wielded |
| Magic wand  | +3 `magic` when wielded |
| Magic garb    | +3 `defense` when worn, can apply to armor or clothes |
| Ring of Protection | You gain the `Hardy` ability |
| Ring of Jumping    | You gain the `Bouncy 2` ability (i.e. +20 jump)|
| Amulett of Fire    | All attacks (spells or combat) deal 5 extra fire damage which bypasses defense|
| Flying carpet    | Flies at a speed of 10 with up to 400 kg load. Can move vertically, controlled mentally by the owner|
| Bag of Holding     | A magic bag which can hold up to 1000 kg or up to 1000 liters of content. Content must fit into an opening of 50 cm|
| Nightvision goggles| You gain the `Nightvision` ability, but can only see shades of gray |
